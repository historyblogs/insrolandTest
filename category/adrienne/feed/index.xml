Ask Main street resident, Charles Whittaker, whom police busted for dealing morphine and other narcotics in April 1919.  Police Detectives Canto, Vernand, Winn and O’Brien caught Whittaker with a small box, containing 1000 morphine tablets valued at $1000, in his possession. According to police, a drug ring in San Francisco had been mailing packages of narcotics to Whittaker at his 410 South Main Street residence. Investigators told the <em>Los Angeles Times </em> that four packages of 1000 tablets each had been delivered to Whittaker a month for the past year.    Whittaker, a grocery salesman, claimed he had no knowledge of what was in the package in his possession and did not know the senders. Perhaps he was just holding it for a friend who had ducked into Marks-Fram Co. next door at 412 S. Main Street (pictured above) to pick up a few postcards.   Illustration credit: Brent C.
