<p>Walking in the alley behind the Sisters of Mercy building, where unfortunates were fed and housed, Fred Forsberg made a grim discovery: a partially mummified section of a human skull, with incongruously handsome, twirled moustaches above the former lips. The top of the skull had been neatly sawn off, suggesting the corpse had paid a visit to an anatomical laboratory. </p>
<p>Forsberg attempted to interest the police in his discovery, but to them it looked too old to be worth investigating. They did, however, deign to attach a note which read &#8220;ex-police reporter&#8221; and parked the relic in the station&#8217;s reporter&#8217;s room. And it was this prank which resulted in a few inches of column space in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> the following day, and keeps alive the memory of this nameless posthumous denizen of SRO Land. Here&#8217;s to ya, fella, whoever you were.</p>
