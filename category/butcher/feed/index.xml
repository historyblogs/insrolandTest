Mosher, 53, left his shop at 1703 East Washington Street and drove his horse-drawn rig, a sort of open carriage, home to 232 ½ Winston Street, to dine with his family. His wife and adult children were waiting for him to come to the table when they heard a loud rattle as of a malfunctioning wagon, and ran outside to find Mosher lying half a block away, his rig on top of his crushed chest. He died moments later. </p>

The body was taken to Bresee Brothers on Mortuary Row at 855 South Figueroa, with a coroner&#8217;s inquest to precede burial.<br /><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/112695133_098951d279_o.jpg" border="0" alt="Bresee Brothers detail" /></p>
