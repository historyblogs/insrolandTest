				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve discovered another mysterious disappearance tied to the Cecil Hotel. This one somehow eluded all previous archival searches, and it&#8217;s quite an odd and interesting case. I call it The Case of the Missing Consul.</p>
<p><a title="Galbraith feel grave concern over missing headline by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8516677520/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8516677520_b6f9a18a6a_o.png" alt="Galbraith feel grave concern over missing headline" width="145" height="61" /></a></p>
<p>Around noon on December 31, 1947, Alexander M. Galbraith, 50, stepped out of the office where he had served for the past four years as the British Consul for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and vanished. His daughter Jean, who was his secretary, said he&#8217;d been brooding about the possibility of losing his position to one of the career diplomats who&#8217;d been freed up by the end of the war. He was right to worry. That very morning, he&#8217;d been informed that his services were no longer needed. The reason given was that, though Scottish-born, he was a naturalized American.</p>
<p>Galbraith, who&#8217;d been a WW1 flying ace and had a fiery reputation, was incensed. He was passionate about his position, giving pro-British speeches to local men&#8217;s clubs, dedicating long hours to aiding war brides whose American grooms had abandoned them. And now some bureaucrat was going to take his place? It was too much for him to stand.</p>
<p>On New Years Day, Deputy Coroner Ken O&#8217;Toole said Galbraith had come in, asking about a pair of missing spectacles. But a search of the neighborhood came up empty. A Pullman porter saw a photograph of the missing man, and told police he was certain he&#8217;d served him on a train bound for Chicago. Chicago authorities were alerted, but Galbraith was nowhere to be found. Searches in Washington and Cleveland also turned up nothing.</p>
<p>His wife and daughters were frantic. Weeks passed with no word. The shame of losing his job must have been too much. Had Galbraith killed himself?</p>
<p>He had not.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1948, Galbraith sent a telegram to George B. Stelluto, proprietor of The Green Grill near the Pittsburgh morgue, asking for a loan of $50. Stelluto, a friend, went to the police.</p>
<p><a title="former Greens Grill no Common Plea 310 Ross Street Pittsburgh Google Street View copy by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8516686130/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8516686130_c7bc50c737.jpg" alt="former Greens Grill no Common Plea 310 Ross Street Pittsburgh Google Street View copy" width="500" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>Later, Galbraith told reporters in Los Angeles that he&#8217;d only wired Stelluto because he didn&#8217;t have any money for food. He needed a stake to get back on his feet.</p>
<p>So what had happened to him?</p>
<p><a title="Galbraith pale AP image by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8515562669/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8515562669_7982094821.jpg" alt="Galbraith pale AP image" width="230" height="435" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I blew my top when I was informed I had been relieved. I packed my bag with several suits and came by train, although I have very little recollection of my departure or arrival. I don&#8217;t remember much until I came to here in this hotel. I vaguely recall being in Canton, Ohio and Chicago, but I&#8217;m not sure how I got here or what I did during that week.&#8221; He said he hadn&#8217;t wanted &#8220;to be a burden&#8221; to his wife of daughters. As for the telegram, he supposed that Stelluto, thinking &#8220;he was serving my interests best&#8221; had gone to the Chief of Police. &#8220;Maybe he was serving my best interests. I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached at home, his daughter Jean said &#8220;We&#8217;re all very much relieved that Daddy&#8217;s been located. We certainly don&#8217;t feel that he&#8217;ll be a burden on us and we&#8217;re going to send him the money to fly home. I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t have trouble finding another job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galbraith was one of the lucky ones. Many other&nbsp;<a href="http://insroland.org/ghostsofthececil" target="_blank">troubled souls</a>&nbsp;had found a bed at the Cecil and lacked the courage to ask for help. He went home. Reporters, who always want more, asked after him. Jean said that he was somewhat unwell from his travels, and was resting. Jean protected her father well. We hear nothing more about him, and sometimes hearing nothing is the happiest ending of all.</p>

<p>It was with shock and no small amount of horror that we learned that a body, believed to be that of Canadian tourist Elisa Lam, last seen behaving strangely in an elevator security video recorded on February 1, had been discovered today within one of the water tanks on the Cecil Hotel&#8217;s roof. A complaint about low water pressure had prompted an employee to look inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Cecil Hotel roof helicopter screen shot february 19 2013 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8491046418/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8491046418_037307c15e_o.png" alt="Cecil Hotel roof helicopter screen shot february 19 2013" width="618" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hotels by their nature are the backdrop for extreme behavior, and any public building that stands for the better part of a century will collect its share of tragedies. The Cecil (established 1927) is notable among true crime aficionados as the short-term residence of serial killers Jack Unterweger and Richard Ramirez, and in all the attention paid to those grim gentlemen, the hotel&#8217;s other heartbreaks too often go unmourned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probable fate of Miss Lam inspires us to compose a memorial note, to the five prior ladies (and one unfortunate fellow) who left this world on the grounds of the Cecil Hotel, and whose wraiths may yet haunt the place.</p>
<p><a title="hotel-cecil-ad for web by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8491046412/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8491046412_beaa5a459e.jpg" alt="hotel-cecil-ad for web" width="288" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>On June 4, 1964, &#8220;Pigeon Goldie&#8221; Osgood, retired telephone operator and well known protector and feeder of the birds in Pershing Square, was found dead in her room by a hotel worker distributing phone books. She had been stabbed, strangled and raped, and her room ransacked.&nbsp; Near her body were found the Dodgers cap she always wore and a paper sack full of birdseed. Soon after, Jacques B. Ehlinger, 29, was seen walking through Pershing Square in bloodstained clothing. He was arrested, but cleared of the crime, for which no one was ever arrested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Goldie&#8217;s friends came together in Pershing Square to express their grief. Jean Rosenstein, a retired nurse, told a reporter &#8220;We were all her friends, all of us here at the square. I was just standing here this morning, thinking about what had happened, when somebody suggested we get some flowers. No one has much money around here, but all of a sudden everyone started giving me what they could. We just wanted her to know we remembered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigeon Goldie, we remember you, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was October 12, 1962 and Pauline Otton, 27, had been arguing with her estranged husband Dewey in a room on the ninth floor when he decided he’d had enough and went out to get some dinner. She decided she’d had enough, too, and jumped from the window. She landed on top of a pedestrian, George Gianinni, 65, and both were killed instantly. Since no one saw Pauline jump, police initially thought they had a double suicide on their hands&#8211;but on closer examination, George had his hands in his pockets and was still wearing shoes, which would have been unlikely if he’d fallen ninety feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pauline, and George, we remember.</p>
<p>On February 11, 1962, Julia Moore climbed out of her eighth floor room window and landed in a second story interior light well. She left no note, just a bus ticket from St. Louis, 59 cents in change, and an Illinois bank book showing a balance of $1800.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Julia, we remember.</p>
<p>On October 22, 1954, Helen Gurnee, 50-something, stepped from her seventh floor window and crashed to her death atop the hotel&#8217;s marquee. She had registered as Margaret Brown a week before.</p>
<p>Helen—or Margaret, as she preferred—we remember.</p>
<p>Elisa Lam, 21, left her home in Vancouver for a solo trip to California. Her plans after visiting Los Angeles were to continue north to Santa Cruz, but it seems that she never left Main Street.</p>
<p>She had the great misfortune to vanish while the Los Angeles Police Department was absorbed with one of the largest manhunts in its history, and one cannot but wonder what impact the search for Christopher Dorner had upon the search for Elisa Lam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps she climbed up the side of the water tank, lifted the hatch, slipped inside, drowned, and then floated there for weeks until her body sank and blocked the pipes. Maybe someone who knew the nooks and crannies of this very old establishment put her there. In time, the answer will come, but it will make no great difference. She is gone, and she remains.</p>
<p>Elisa, we remember. And hope the souls that went before can lend some comfort now to yours.</p>

<p><a title="Bank of America, Broadway &amp; 7th (LAPL) by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5578142596/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5578142596_c28b006ae9.jpg" alt="Bank of America, Broadway &amp; 7th (LAPL)" width="391" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The desperate man walked into the Bank of America branch and crossed the lobby to the second teller window&#8211;to Mrs. Joy Holker, 28, the one with the kind eyes. He handed her a brown envelope and a note which read &#8220;This is a holdup. Fill up the envelope. Also have a jar of acid.&#8221; She obeyed, quickly stacking $540 in $10 bills and passing them across the counter. But as she counted, she gave her robber the once-over. She didn&#8217;t buy it, not from this guy. As he turned away, she came out from behind the counter and chased him onto Broadway, screaming &#8220;Stop that man!&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="victim by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5578092128/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5578092128_1e47afc949.jpg" alt="victim" width="149" height="323" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">A motorcycle cop, Charles Randolph, heard her cries, as did patrolman R. Mierdiercks. They took off after the robber, who had darted east on 7<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> Street. He turned south down Spring, and tried to hide in a parking lot mid-block. They busted him there, and he surrendered peacefully.</p>
<p class="p2"><a title="robber by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5578092062/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5578092062_bb21599e8b.jpg" alt="robber" width="388" height="500" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Kenneth St. Onge, 35, had a cap pistol, a bottle of colored water and a sob story. He said he&#8217;d come out from Detroit with his wife and seven sons last September, but couldn&#8217;t find any work. For three weeks, the family slept in their 1947 Studebaker, until wife Esther found work as a waitress. They&#8217;d then moved into a quonset hut at 1480 Landa Street, rent $25 a week plus utilities. After two months, the electric bill came. It was $67, which is how they learned their landlord had wired up an apartment, a trailer and a garage to their meter. With only one pair of decent shoes for all the children, he&#8217;d spend his days driving first one, then another child to attend a class or two, then pick up Esther. Whatever she made in tips, that was their dinner fund. Everything else went to the landlord.</p>
<p class="p2">Then Esther got pregnant again, and couldn&#8217;t stay on her feet all day. They had nothing left.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know what else to do, so he did this.&nbsp; &#8220;I guess I knew I&#8217;d get caught, but I figured at least the State would have to take care of my wife and kids,&#8221; he mused.</p>
<p class="p2">Los Angeles briefly fell in love with the sad sack, especially after he appeared on local television bemoaning his fate. Over $1000 in donations poured in, along with clothes for the kids and a job for daddy at City of Hope. The family was offered a furnished home in La Puente for nothing down.</p>
<p class="p2"><a title="family by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5577504841/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5132/5577504841_f6b35ccb22.jpg" alt="family" width="500" height="414" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Just over a month after his life of crime fizzled out, a proud Kenneth St. Onge celebrated Easter with his wife and children in court, as Judge Thurmond Clarke ruled &#8220;Because of your record, your family and your children, I am going to grant you probabtion in this case. For robbing a national bank, I&#8217;ve certainly been very lenient.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;People have been so kind. I know everything is going to turn out all right now. This is,&#8221; said St. Onge, &#8220;the best break I ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">And all he had to do to get it was to cross over to the dark side. There&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere, we guess, maybe nothing more profound than that most folks like to hear about someone who&#8217;s got it even worse than they do.</p>

<p>Sleeping Joe Schutton was roused from his rest by an ungodly clash and clatter, and when he lit his lamp found a pair of thrashing man&#8217;s legs dangling from the ceiling as the man above made obvious attempts to escape back onto the roof through which he&#8217;d broken. Irked Joe would have none of that, and clung to the kicking feet, screaming loudly for aid.</p>
<p>Patrolmen Sweeney and Kierscey were quick on the scene, and taking an accounting of the situation, raced to the roof where they extracted O.W. Coppington, 35, and asked what the hell he thought he was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the victim here,&#8221; swore Coppington, who told a convoluted tale of being halted at Winston near Main by a pair of highwaymen, who he&#8217;d eluded by racing up the first stairwell he spied, then out onto one roof, then another, then another&#8211;searching for an open skylight he could escape through. But when he leapt from a tall roof to a lower one, the shingles, lath and plaster broke away, waking Joe Schutton and leading to Coppington&#8217;s arrest. Skeptical, Sweeney and Kierscey took their prize back to City Jail for further conversation, while Joe Schutton shook the ceiling chips out of his sheets and tried to get back to sleep.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; background-color: #ffffff;">October 15, 1967</span></p>
<p>Late on Sunday morning, Florence Beaumont, 56-year-old former English teacher, Unitarian peace activist and mother of two, gathered a selection of literature pertaining to her activities in the anti-Vietnam war movement, climbed into her pickup truck with its Peace and Freedom Party bumper sticker and drove from her home in La Puente to downtown Los Angeles. </p>
<p>At 1:05pm, after climbing the steps of the new Federal Building, Florence poured most of a can of gasoline over herself, put the can down on a wall and lit a match. She immediately erupted in flames, let out a cry, and walked about 40 feet before collapsing, an unrecognizable charred mass. Over by the gas can was her purse, with a card taped to the front which read &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m Florence Beaumont.&#8221;<br /><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2706/4289897580_3882499864.jpg" alt="" /><br />Federal Building guard Ben Brown heard a scream, ran outside and saw the woman in flames. He returned to his post for a fire extinguisher, but arrived too late to help her. Retiree John Osberg was sunning himself on the steps nearby and heard a moan, looking up to see Florence burning and walking along the veranda. &#8220;There were flames all over her. She didn&#8217;t say anything, she just moaned. She was burning from head to foot.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Two nights earlier, Florence had told a friend, Ada Pettigrove, that she had been thinking of immolating herself. Ada told her not to talk like that, and put off mentioning the conversation to Florence&#8217;s husband George because she had to leave for San Diego to retrieve a lost dog. &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t think she would carry it out. I guess I really didn&#8217;t know her that well.&#8221;<br /><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2803/4289227605_7450a4404e_o.png" alt="" /><br />On Tuesday, Florence&#8217;s widower George held a press conference at the Greater Los Angeles Press Club, where he read a prepared statement saying that he had not known what she planned to do. He said his wife had been deeply troubled because it seemed that elected officials didn&#8217;t care about her concerns. </p>
<p>She had &#8220;a deep feeling against the slaughter in Vietnam&#8230; She was a perfectly normal, dedicated person, and felt she had to do this just like the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c" target="_blank">monks</a> and nuns] who burned themselves in Vietnam. I never felt she would take this road, but I can see how she might have felt she had to do it&#8230;. This was no suicide. There were no indications of escapism or frustration. This was an immolation, a supreme sacrifice to humanity, to peace and freedom for all mankind. In a sense, it was a religious rite far beyond the hypocritical posturings of orthodoxy&#8230; The barbarous napalm that burns the bodies of the Vietnamese children has seared the souls of all who, like Florence Beaumont, do not have icewater for blood, stones for hearts. The match that Florence used to touch off her gasoline-soaked clothing has lighted a fire that will not go out&#8211;ever&#8211; a fire under us complacent, smug fat cats so damned secure in our ivory towers 9,000 miles from exploding napalm, and THAT, we are sure, is the purpose of her act. &#8220;</p>
<p>Exactly one week after her death, 500 people gathered at the site of Florence&#8217;s immolation to honor her memory. She was one of five people who died after setting themselves ablaze in America to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolations_in_protest_to_the_Vietnam_War" target="_blank">protest</a> the war in Vietnam. Eight years later, the war ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain&#8221; Maximilian Wolf, self-styled, was a visionary of early Los Angeles. He arrived from San Francisco with a colleague who planned to host a fair at Hazard&#8217;s Pavilion at 5th and Olive, went mad for a spell, was freed, then entered into a period of creative mania.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />In 1896 he sought to demonstrate the efficacy of his theories on alternative transport by way of a Water Bicycle, a device comprised of two fifteen-by-two-foot pontoons on each of which a bike was placed. By pushing the pedals, a series of cogs revolved, eventually powering two fishy fins beneath each pontoon. Put an awning up, and one could enjoy a cigar or cool tea on the open water. A rudder, at the front of the device, turned with the handlebars&#8211;but Wolf refused to tell reporters what would happen if the two riders wished to go in different directions.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2689/4273006371_a1ccddb9fd_o.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Perhaps this is a design flaw the good &#8220;Captain&#8221; should have paid more mind to, as the planned date for his demonstration ride in early 1896 slipped always over the next wave. For machine shop owner S.D. Sturgis, who had built the marvel &#8220;on spec&#8221; was now holding the craft hostage in the back of his store, insisting Wolf pay for the work before any lakeside show was put on. When Sturgis appeared, a nervous Wolf scurried off, mid-interview with a man from the Times.</p>
<p>Months passed, and there was no report of the wonderful Water Bicycle ever getting wet. Wolf turned instead to designing an air ship and told all who would listen how marvelous it would be when completed.</p>
<p>Then in September, Wolf took a most peculiar cab ride with a hack called H.A. Lowell. He asked first to be taken to County Hospital, complaining on the way of blood poisoning. But on learning there were no private rooms available, he asked Lowell to continue on to Boyle Heights, to his old friend Mrs. Hollenbeck&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hollenbeckhome.com/" target="_blank">home</a> where all the old folks stayed. He wrote a letter in German for the lady, but she claimed not to know him and turned him away. </p>
<p>From there, Lowell was compelled to convey Wolf to a nearby nursery, where the German proprietor reluctantly admitted to knowing the passenger, but refused to loan him $5. Then Wolf asked to be taken to the Masonic Hall, but the exasperated Lowell took him instead to jail, where he was relieved of his gold-headed cane and the lunacy commission called in.</p>
<p>Wolf then vanishes from the record, and his marvelous, futuristic craft with him.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the tearful relatives of Raymundo Reyes, 74, gathered at Calvary Cemetery for his burial. Not a week later, Reyes turned up, very much alive.</p>
<p>Who then had died, this man who looked so much like Reyes that the whole family was fooled? No one had a clue until today, when Adam Kryst, an elderly pensioner, was reported missing from a rooming house at 224 Boyd Street. </p>
<p>Police Sgt. Tom Anderson of the missing persons bureau obtained the three keys found on the dead man&#8217;s person and went to Boyd Street, where he opened the front door, the door of Adam Kryst&#8217;s room, and a chest inside it. A fingerprint technician matched prints found in the room to those taken from the corpse. </p>
<p>And so the mystery was solved, but one awkward problem remained: Kryst&#8217;s family, coming from Florida, must reach some agreement with the Reyes family regarding the somewhat decayed man occupying their relative&#8217;s grave. Let&#8217;s hope at least he was a Catholic!</p>

<p>Pity Mrs. Anna Mulloy, who dabbled in the psychic sciences and discovered that the world of shadows and secrets is no place for a flesh and blood woman to linger.</p>
<p>Anna first looked to the mysteries back home in Manitou, Colorado, where her husband M.E. was busy with his work as a contractor. She found she had a gift for hearing the voices of the dead, and what else could she do then but to listen? <em>&#8220;He&#8217;s cheating on you,&#8221;</em> the voices said, <em>&#8220;he loves another.&#8221;</em> And so in August 1899, Anna took her four little children and went to California. M.E. Mulloy sent her regular checks.</p>
<p>But now the voices sang a new tune. <em>&#8220;Take the children,&#8221;</em> they said, <em>&#8220;Go to the grandest hotel you can find, and stay the night.&#8221;</em> Sometimes the voices were so insistent that Anna checked her brood into the Westminster itself &#8211; at a lordly cost of $2.50 a night!<br /><img style="vertical-align: middle; border: 3px solid black;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2499/4132575484_cab28eb021.jpg" alt="Westminster Hotel (USC collection)" width="500" height="398" /><br />But it was in more modest lodgings in SRO land from which Anna penned the inspired missive that would bring her exhausting journey to an end. It was twelve pages in length and barely coherent, and when she had finished it, she placed it in an envelope addressed &#8220;Policeman, Los Angeles, CA&#8221; and asked one of her little ones to deliver it. Officer Zeigler accepted the packet, and soon Humane Officer Craig arrived, to take Anna away to the County Hospital on a lunacy complaint, and the little children to the Home of Mercy, just down the way on Boyd Street, to await instructions from their father in Colorado.</p>

<p>Shopkeeper William &#8220;Scotty&#8221; Manson, 47, lived alone behind Acme Stamp and Hobby, supplying used books and collectable stamps to the passing trade. Any customer was potentially a worthy one in the SRO Land of 1956, as Bunker Hill was crumbling and the detritus of human life washed ever further each morning onto the streets surrounding Skid Row.</p>
<p>When two gents came in together and asked for a quantity of books to be boxed, Manson thought he&#8217;d made his grubstake for the day. Alas, the fellows had a further request: could he just be so kind as to place all his money in the box as well? A flash of a long knife accompanied the suggestion.</p>
<p>Like any savvy shopkeeper of his place and era, Manson was armed, with a .45 caliber revolver in his pocket. He stepped back and drew his weapon, but the young man with the knife was quicker, and slashed his chest and belly. The would-be thieves turned and ran as Manson unloaded his weapon, then collapsed in the door of his shop. At General Hospital, where he was taken in serious condition with three deep cuts, he told police what had happened.</p>
<p>But even without Scotty&#8217;s report, the scene on the street told the tale. One robber, Charles Brooks, 28, resident of a hotel at 224 Boyd, reached 1st and Broadway, then fell, gushing blood. He survived part of the ride to Georgia Street Receiving Hospital, where he was DOA.</p>
<p>The second miscreant, Eugene Sparkman, resident of a hotel at 534 Wall, made the acquaintance of a motorcycle cop a block from where Brooks went down, and was popped. Taken into evidence was the book he&#8217;d kept hold of as he fled, reform-minded prison warden <a href="http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/old/lawes.htm" target="_blank">Lewis E. Lawes</a>&#8216; &#8220;20,000 Years in Sing Sing,&#8221; with its heartwarming dedication <em>&#8220;To those tens of thousands of my former wards who have justified my faith in human nature.&#8221; </em>We can only hope he ran into as enlightened a prison manager as Lawes, in his unreported but inevitable next stop.</p>

<p>Each day at noon, the little children emerge from their classroom at the San Pedro-street school and tramp off to their respective homes to have a nutritious lunch <em>en famille.</em> Dear little creatures, some barely old enough to walk, who spend their days in learning what life is all about, and the skills they&#8217;ll need to navigate this fresh new city they are lucky enough to be citizens of.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the wee ones engaged in their favorite noontime activity, the tormenting of a Chinese vegetable peddler whose route regrettably takes him near to their school. The children fell upon his wagon, snatching up potatoes with which to pelt the&#8230; well, he was not a man, exactly, he was a <em>Celestial</em>, in the parlance of the day.</p>
<p>Enraged, the victim ran at the diminutive mob, waving his blacksnake whip and shrieking invective. What else could you expect from a savage? All the children scattered, save one terrified three-year-old boy. The vendor obligingly whipped the child about the head and the feet, compelling a passing white man to grab the whip and knock the Chinese to the ground. No one was badly hurt, and the parade moved on &#8212; just a typical happening in 1896 LA for all concerned.&nbsp; </p>
