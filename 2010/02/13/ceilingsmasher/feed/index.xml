<p>Thanks for this guys! I now have a gallery at this address. It was built in 1887 and has a very interesting history. I would love to touch base with Kim and see if she has any more info or ideas where I can get more info regarding 118 Winston.</p>
<p>I pulled the history of the building from the dept. of building and safety and have the permit history which shed a great deal of light on the space.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our site for the building:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;"><a style="cursor: pointer; color: #333333; text-decoration: none;" onmousedown="UntrustedLink.bootstrap($(this), &quot;fbd15d12e93df539701fef5acfe06498&quot;, event)" href="http://118winston.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://118winston.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;">I love what your doing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal; color: #333333;">best,</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;div class=&quot;comment_body&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your feedback, SZ. You have a wonderful old building!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a lot of &quot;hits&quot; for the search string &quot;118 Winston&quot; in the Los Angeles Times digital archives (aka Proquest) which can be searched by anyone with an LAPL card (try &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalog.lapl.org/wc-bin/dbcheck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; on the LAPL site, with your card and PIN number). I haven&#039;t read them all by any stretch, but you should definitely poke around with them and I hope you&#039;ll come back and tell us what you find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on I see that there was a family named Gardner there who had a piano business, and they had a grandson who petitioned the court to permit him to change his name from Sellenscheldt to Sherman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;div class=&quot;comment_body&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you kim!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;after Mr. Gardner it was sold another man (don&#039;t have his name right now, it&#039;s at the office) then in the 40&#039;s it was bought by a Mrs. Sylvia Cresswell who was doing business as &quot;Sister Sylvia&#039;s Soul Patrol&quot;. Apparently she ran it as a free boarding house for alcoholic G.I.s returning from WW2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was that until the 50&#039;s then it became a series of labor halls with men living on the top 2 floors in bunk beds and the ground floor being a kitchen and hiring hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1974 it was taken over by &quot;American Indian Involvement&quot; which ran it as a rescue mission for homeless native americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They left in the early 80&#039;s and it became a toy district store and warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pretty much brings us to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I LOVE this building but it is unfortunately in pretty bad shape.

<p>Thank you kim!</p>
<p>after Mr. Gardner it was sold another man (don&#8217;t have his name right now, it&#8217;s at the office) then in the 40&#8217;s it was bought by a Mrs. Sylvia Cresswell who was doing business as &#8220;Sister Sylvia&#8217;s Soul Patrol&#8221;. Apparently she ran it as a free boarding house for alcoholic G.I.s returning from WW2.</p>
<p>It was that until the 50&#8217;s then it became a series of labor halls with men living on the top 2 floors in bunk beds and the ground floor being a kitchen and hiring hall.</p>
<p>In 1974 it was taken over by &#8220;American Indian Involvement&#8221; which ran it as a rescue mission for homeless native americans.</p>
<p>They left in the early 80&#8217;s and it became a toy district store and warehouse.</p>
<p>That pretty much brings us to the present day.</p>
<p>I LOVE this building but it is unfortunately in pretty bad shape. The wife and I are doing our best to repair it slowly but it&#8217;s a lot of work and money for someone who only leases it.</p>
<p>Oh also, a major scene in the movie &#8220;The Sting&#8221; was filmed here. They had it painted as a Western Union office and while pressure washing years and years of paint and graffitti I found the sting&#8217;s yellow paint.</p>
